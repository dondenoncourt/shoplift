	<p>Thanks for finding your way to The Shoplift.  
	
	<p>We've been hard at work for almost a year now: getting The Shoplift coded, teaching it to do smart things, and above all designing it to be a beautiful and exciting new destination.  A place worth spending your time – not just another place to spend your money.  
	
	<p>Remember what shopping malls used to be like, back before we started carrying the Internet around in our pockets?  Places to hang out and browse around, spot the latest trends and discover the coolest things? 
	
	<p>We’re bringing that back.
	
	<p>At The Shoplift, you can hang out and browse around, just as you would in an old-fashioned mall.  There’s no pressure to buy; just hunt for stuff you like, and follow anyone whose taste you think is cool.  As you shop, grab the items you like most and “shoplift” them: add them to a collection of your own, which we’ll showcase for friends and fans the next time they visit.
	
	<p>The Shoplift is a new kind of shopping mall – a mall that we (the shoppers) are about to build for ourselves.  We’re stealing the job of curating away from the big retailers.  From now on, we get to decide for ourselves what’s cool and what’s not.
	
	<p>We're just ironing out a few last kinks, and we should have the site up and running very soon.  At that point we'll open our doors and you'll be able to give The Shoplift a try.  We won't be issuing phony invites, making you wait for approval, or spinning this as some kind of exclusive online club.  If you have good taste, or enough people think you’re cool, you’ll quickly attract a following, and you’ll probably have a good time.  (And if you’ve heard about us at this point, chances are you're doing something right on the coolness front.)
	
	<p>So: please sign up below, and we'll let you know as soon as the time comes to get started.  Join us as we show the world what shopping looks like in the twenty-first century.
